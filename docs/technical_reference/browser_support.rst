edX application pages render correctly and swiftly in most modern browsers.

**All code must support the latest versions of the browsers mentioned below.**

For best performance, we recommend:

* `Chrome`_
* `Firefox`_

We also support the latest versions of:

* `Microsoft Edge`_
* `Microsoft Internet Explorer`_
* `Safari`_


.. note:: If you use the Safari browser, be aware that it does not support the
 search feature for the guides on `docs.edx.org`_. This is a known limitation.
