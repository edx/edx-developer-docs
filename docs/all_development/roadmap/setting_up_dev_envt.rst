Setting up your development environment
=======================================

You can locally develop Open edX code using two methods: `Devstack`_ and `Tutor`_. Devstack is used extensively by edX developers. They are both used widely by Open edX Community developers.


See `Devstack Getting Started`_ for more info on how to setup Devstack as your development environment.


See `Tutor Getting Started`_ for more info on how to setup Tutor as your development environment.
