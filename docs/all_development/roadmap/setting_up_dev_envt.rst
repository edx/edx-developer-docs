Setting up your development environment
=======================================

You can develop in Open edX using two methods: `Devstack`_ and `Tutor`_.

Devstack

Devstack is local development environment. It is used extensively by edX Developers and is widely used by Open edX Community Developers. It is supported by edX.

The devstack is meant for development only, not for production deployment.

Tutor
